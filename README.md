# Fraud Detection with NLP - Machine Learning Programming Final Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a fraud detection project that combines machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project replicates and extends a research paper, aiming to improve fraud detection accuracy.

Fraud detection is crucial in online and mobile banking due to the growing number of daily transactions. Manual monitoring is no longer practical, leading to the reliance on automated systems to promptly identify potential fraud. While traditional rule-based methods have limitations, machine and deep learning approaches offer flexibility but often require complex setup.

Unlike traditional methods that depend on rules or complex setups, this approach uses Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based features. This simplifies the process, promising more efficient and privacy-conscious fraud detection in online and mobile banking transactions.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - TensorFlow (for neural network models)

## Repository Contents
- `Fraud Detection with Natural Language Processing.rar`: Compressed archive containing the credit card transaction data in a pickled Pandas DataFrame.
- `My_Contribution_in_FraudNLP.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing my contributions to the project.
- `Rimi_Mondal_FinalProject_Report.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook presenting the final project report.
- `Rimi_Mondal_FinalProject_Report.pdf`: PDF version of the final project report for easy reference.
- `creditmerged.csv`: Additional dataset created by merging data from different folders, used for testing and analysis.
- `vocab.csv`: This file has a list of action names and their corresponding IDs.

## Instructions for Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-nlp.git
2. **Extract the Project Files:**

 - Extract the contents of `Fraud Detection with Natural Language Processing.rar` to a directory of your choice.

3. **Explore the Notebooks:**
